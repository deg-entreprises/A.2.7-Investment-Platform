 ## Purpose

`What is the purpose of your platform and what is the current state of its development`

DEG's platform aims to enable Rwandan Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers to actively engage in the future of African Malanga Neutral Alcohol Supply Chains. Currently, we are developing a series of interconnected platforms over ten years called 'epicPlaylist', comprising multiple quarter-long segments known as 'beatDrops'. Our present focus is on the second beatDropâ€”B.0.9 Onboarding Platform for trainingfarb, which lasts until April 6th, 2024.

## Problem

`What is the problem associated with today's meeting?`

There are twelve teams joining DEG's platform ecosystem who require assistance integrating themselves successfully. The challenge lies in guiding these teams efficiently while managing thirteen distinct Minimum Viable Platforms in a decentralized manner via GitHub Projects.

## Solution

`How will this meeting approach a solution?`

In today's meeting, trainfarb will concentrate on completing DEG's agendas, minutes, and debriefs for each of the twelve teams in GitHub Projects. These records will connect to individual accounts hosting specific project boards, facilitating efficient management of diverse focus areas. Additionally, each team is assigned to develop a unified workPad and adhere to an 8-part story structure, ensuring consistency throughout the whole process.

## Market

`What risks will this solution help mitigate?`

By establishing a consistent API framework combining workPads and Dan Harmon's story structure, potential issues arising from varying locations, cultures, or misaligned objectives amongst participating teams may be significantly reduced.

## Product

`What will be the final result that represents a successful meeting outcome?`

At the conclusion of the meeting, each team must possess completed workPads tailored for their respective platforms, integrated seamlessly into DEG's platform ecosystem. Moreover, trainfarb shall finish recording thorough documentation related to all teams' projects in GitHub repositories.

## Distribution

`How will you share the successful meeting outcome with the open source community?`

Following the completion of the meetings, DEG will make available the documented resources and assets connected to the various teams' Minimum Viable Platforms, encouraging further enhancement and adaptation opportunities within the broader open-source community.

## Actions

`What metrics and actions are you planning to track as the story of today's work evolves?`

Throughout the duration of today's tasks, several key performance indicators (KPIs) and action points include tracking daily progress, monitoring the quality of outputs produced by each team, maintaining central oversight concerning integration and compatibility concerns, and assessing overall satisfaction levels regarding the efficiency and usefulness of introduced tools such as APIs and workPads.

## Team

`Who is involved in contributing to today's platform?`

Twelve teams contribute to today's platform, namely trainfarb (for B.0.9), hu3agency (for B.9.0), ourStory, Balance Period, Elephant & Falcon (for C.1.8), Quantum MeMoir, Healthy Intentions (for D.8.1), Nicole's Magic (for E.7.2), JRs Joyous Creations (for F.6.3), The School of Bitcoin (for G.5.4), Make Light of It (for H.4.5), and Pangium (for I.3.6). Together, they strive towards achieving success in the ongoing beatDrop phase of DEG's epicPlaylist initiative.
