 #### Purpose

`What is the purpose of your platform and what is your current focus?`

DEG is committed to supporting Rwandan Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers in participating in the evolution of African Malanga Neutral Alcohol Supply Chains. At the moment, two primary goals consume our attention:

1. **B.0.9.0.1 Developing Onboarding Documentation for Populating a P3 Memo workPad:** Crafting exhaustive and insightful documentation aimed at equipping innovators with the ability to encapsulate their vision concisely and appealingly. This material serves as a foundation for onboarding sessions, bolstering communication between passionate founders and potential supporters.
2. **Integrating Past Meetings into DEG's P3 Ecosystem:** Leveraging previous discussions to fortify the infrastructure and maximize benefits derived from prior engagements. Specifically, we intend to incorporate the valuable insights gleaned from the *Rwanda Development Board (RDB) Kick-off Meeting* held on September 28, 2023.

#### Problem

`What is the problem associated with today's meeting?`

Two significant hurdles demand attention today:

1. Articulation Challenge: Creatives and entrepreneurs often struggle to distill complex ideas into digestible summaries, hindering their search for investors and contributors. Consequently, talent remains untapped, and promising initiatives stagnate.
2. Unutilized Resources: DEG houses ample data from past conferences; however, neglecting to assimilate these findings into contemporary operations squanders both energy invested initially and potential advancements afforded by synthesizing collective wisdom.

#### Solution

`How will this meeting work towards a solution?`

Our strategic approach comprises dual tracks to counteract the outlined problems:

1. Targeted Prompt Generation: Formulating a meticulous set of prompts empowers founders to elucidate core facets of their vision, capturing investor interest and accelerating partnership formation.
2. Standardized Process Implementation: Devising a systematic procedure to consolidate historical meetings within DEG's P3 Ecosystem guarantees that vital discoveries aren't overlooked, propelling innovation forward.

#### Market

`What risks will this solution help mitigate?`

Addressing these issues contributes to minimizing the following threats:

1. Founder Burnout: Effective ideation translation alleviates undue pressure on zealous initiators, reducing strain and preventing burnout caused by excessive self-imposed labor.
2. Resource Efficiency: Systematically absorbing previous breakthroughs preserves hard-earned capital, averting unnecessary financial losses due to redundant undertakings.

#### Product

`What will be the final result that represents a successful meeting outcome?`
